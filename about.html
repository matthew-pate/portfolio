        <p>I am currently working in product support at <a href="http://conversionlogix.com">Conversion Logix, Inc.</a>
          for the company’s SaaS application, <a href="http://theconversioncloud.com">The
            Conversion Cloud®</a>. I work cross-functionally with multiple teams, including client services, customer
          success,
          software engineering, operations, and research and product development, while providing technical support,
          prioritizing development tasks, evaluating the department’s performance, and implementing department changes.
          In addition to these responsibilities, I also perform quality assurance software testing and product
          management activities. Prior to this, I managed email, display, and search advertising campaigns for many
          national real estate investment, development, and management firms on behalf of Conversion Logix, Inc.</p><br>

        <p>Before making the transition to advertising and MarTech, I acquired over a decade of experience in customer
          service and call center operations with ADT Security, Samsung, Apple, and General Motors, among others. My
          roles in these organizations ranged from tier 1 triage and support to legal disputes, and software engineer
          and developer support.</p><br>

        <p>My experiences have led me toward an interest in developing and delivering products people love.</p><br>

        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy listening to and reviewing music, reading, and exploring the city and traveling
          with
          my wife, daughter, and pets.</p><br>
